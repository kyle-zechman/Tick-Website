# Tick-Website
Objective - I wanted to make a page that fit all on one screen with no scrolling required. The articles presented would populate in their own div.

What I learned - For this I had to learn how to change class lists of objects using JavaScript so I could outline only the currently selected object. I also needed to change the content of an element based on the selected object.
